subtitle: Will your next webapp use Ferro?
---

Hopefully you now have a good first impression of what Ferro looks
like and you are convinced by Ferro\'s promise of simplifying
web development.

As this website demonstrates, Ferro is already quite usable.
More work is needed to have all the nice things in codinglife
for creating a full webapp.  
Also Ferro is just a first stab at making a library to
support a _NoHtml_ style of web development. Other coding styles
are possible, for instance using a domain specific language
(as long as it doesn\'t look like html).  
So if you have ideas to improve Ferro don\'t keep em to yourself,
post them on Github instead.

There are 2 more pages in this website for your perusal,
the frequently asked questions and another code example.
